## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server at `http://localhost:3000` and automatically open it in your browser.

### 3. Set Up Webflow Devlink

To sync components from your Webflow project:

1. **Enable Devlink in Webflow:**
   - Open your Webflow project
   - Go to Project Settings
   - Navigate to the "Devlink" tab
   - Enable Devlink for your project

2. **Install Devlink CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @webflow/devlink-cli
   ```

3. **Initialize Devlink in your project:**
   ```bash
   npx wf devlink init
   ```

   Follow the prompts to authenticate and select your Webflow site.

4. **Sync your components:**
   ```bash
   npx wf devlink sync
   ```

   This will download your Webflow components into the `devlink/` folder.

### 4. Using Webflow Components in React

Once synced, you can import and use your Webflow components in your React code:

```tsx
import { YourWebflowComponent } from '../devlink';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <YourWebflowComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production (type-checks and builds)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm start` - Alias for `npm run dev`

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Next-generation frontend tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Webflow Devlink** - Sync Webflow designs to React

## Styling

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. You can:
- Use Tailwind utility classes in your custom React components
- Webflow components will bring their own styles
- Combine both approaches as needed

To customize Tailwind, edit `tailwind.config.js`.

## Notes

- The `devlink/` folder is auto-generated by Webflow. You can choose to commit it to version control or add it to `.gitignore` if you prefer to sync it locally.
- Components synced from Webflow will include their styles and interactions
- You can create custom React components in the `src/` directory and use them alongside Webflow components
- Tailwind is configured to scan the `devlink/` folder, so you can use Tailwind classes in Webflow components too
